            <h4>New School Canteen</h4>
            <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-resonsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organized and more efficient than in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the best nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school canteen account on the scholl website that keep track of the previous meal choices and any dietary requirements that they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here agin, diversity is the key.

            <ht>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</ht>
            <img src-"attendance.jpg" class-"img-responsive col-lg-5 col-ad-5 col-sm-5 col-x2-12">1. Accuracy

            1. Accuracy Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational
            devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize
            the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide 
            accurate performance and payroll data.

            2.Economics Have you ever thought that attendence management systems control costs? It saves money 
            by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, being absent, tardiness, time abuse,
            and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Assium Group found that large organizations 
            save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.

            3.Productivity/Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious,
            and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, autorize 
            leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated 
            system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information
            into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of 
            resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
